# Arduino_Projects
Sofware Used: Arduino IDE

Mini-Projects using Arduino:

-LCD calculator
-Photo resistor and Buzzer
-Pushbuttons to toggle an LED
-SIPO shift register using LED's
-Controlling ServoMotors using Joystick
-Controlling StepperMotors using a Motor Driver
-Combination of DHT11 and LCD to measure room humidity and temperature
-HCSR04 Sensor to measure speed of sound


Major Project || Bluetooth-Controlled RC Car with Obstacle Detection ||:

-Developed an Arduino-based RC car operated via Bluetooth for remote control functionality
-Integrated HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby obstacles and automatically stop the car
-Implemented a buzzer alert system to notify the user when an object is within a set proximity
-Utilized an SPST switch to manage the power supply to the entire system
-Employed four 6V gear motors for movement, controlled using an L293D motor shield
-Assembled and programmed the system using an Arduino Uno and Bluetooth module for communication
